        <span> LANGLEY, VA - A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.</span> <br> <br>
        <span> According to the report, sections of the documents- "almost invariably the most crucial passages" - are marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947. </span> <br> <br>
        <span> CIA Director Porter Goss lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several historic events, such as: 
          <ul>
            <li> the Cold War </li> 
            <li> the civil-rights movement </li>
            <li> the growth of the international drug trade </li> 
          </ul>
